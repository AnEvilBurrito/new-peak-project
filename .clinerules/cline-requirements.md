**Instructions for Coding AI Agent: Task Planning and Execution**

**Objective:** Improve code planning by breaking down tasks into concise, structured components before implementation. Focus on clarity and brevity.

**Process:**
1. **Outline Key Requirements:**
   - Analyze the task description.
   - Identify and list the core functional requirements in bullet points.
   - Keep each point brief and specific (e.g., "Validate user input," "Store data securely").

2. **Outline Implementation Steps:**
   - Based on the requirements, define the sequential steps for coding.
   - Use simple, action-oriented sentences for each step (e.g., "Implement input validation function," "Set up database connection").

3. **Outline Key Considerations:**
   - Note any critical factors, constraints, or trade-offs (e.g., "Performance impact of encryption," "Compatibility with existing libraries").

**Constraints:**
- Avoid verbose explanations; use minimal words.
- Do not write code until the outline is complete.
- Ensure each section is logically separated and easy to scan.
